# Experiment 2: Numerical Python (NumPy)
## Course: ECE 2112 - Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms <br/>
**Institution**: University of Santo Tomas, Faculty of Enginering, Electronics Engineering Department

## Introduction
This is the second experiment for ECE 2112: Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms. For this experiment, the programmer will deal with Numerical Python or also known as NumPy. Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with arrays. 

## Intended Learning Outcomes
This experiment deals with two learning outcomes, mainly:
To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Numpy library.
To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Numpy library.

## Summary of Problems
### NORMALIZATION PROBLEM
- SHORT BACKGROUND: Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means   subtracting the data from the mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation. Mathematically, normalization can be expressed as:

- INSTRUCTIONS: Create a random 5x5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. The normalized ndarray file should be named as X_normalized.npy

### DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM
- INSTRUCTIONS: Create the following 10x10 ndarray [PASTE] which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers. 
From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the file of the result as div_by_3.npy

## How can this be related to real-life?
Python has many applications in real-life especially now that the world revolves around the use of technology. Some of the top real-life applications of Python are:
- Web Development
- Game Development
- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Science
- Audio and Visual or Image Processing

## Best Practices to do when Coding
When coding, it is best to do practices that would help you efficiently write codes. The top 5 best practices when coding in Python are:
- Usage of descriptive variable names.
- Usage of variables for constants.
- Leaving comments and taking documentation.
- Usage of whitespace.
- Be consistent with the codes.
